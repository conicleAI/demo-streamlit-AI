Chatbot Response: \"Great question! The Freemium Model is a business strategy where basic services are provided free of charge, but users can pay for premium features. For instance, Spotify uses this model by offering free access to music with ads, while users can pay for a premium subscription to get an ad-free experience and additional features. Pretty cool, right? ðŸ˜Š\"
